# Exploring Hacker News Posts

This project explores user-submitted posts on Hacker News using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis focuses on which types of posts receive the most comments and at what time of day.

## 📊 Goals

- Compare Ask HN and Show HN posts by average comments
- Analyze comment activity by post creation hour
- Identify the best time to post for maximum engagement

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `datetime` module
- Lists, loops, dictionaries

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Ask HN posts receive more comments on average than Show HN posts**
- **Posting around 3 PM UTC receives the highest engagement**

## 📁 Files

- `hacker_news_analysis.ipynb`: the complete Jupyter Notebook analysis
- `hacker_news.csv`: the dataset (source: Dataquest)

## ✅ Next Steps

- Analyze which posts get the most points (upvotes)
- Visualize trends using Matplotlib or Seaborn
